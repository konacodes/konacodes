i make things for screens. mostly web stuff. sometimes useful, sometimes just to see if i can.

currently in a reset phase — less planning, more building.

**lately:**
- built an api that serves sea lion facts. no reason.
- made a jargon translator that turns "let's talk" into corporate speak
- still tweaking my site's animations (they're never done)

**usually:**
- typescript, react, node, python
- cloudflare for everything that needs to exist somewhere
- bun because npm is too slow and life is short

i like making things that feel good to use. the small details — transitions, spacing, the way something responds to a click. that stuff matters.

when i'm not coding: probably redesigning something that didn't need it, or up too late again.
