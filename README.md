### hey, i'm kona

i build things for the web. currently in a reset phase — tinkering, experimenting, figuring out what's next.

```js
const kona = {
  code: ["typescript", "react", "node", "python"],
  interests: ["creative coding", "ui/ux", "open source"],
  currently: "building cool stuff",
  mass: null  // couldn't find it
};
```

<summary>more about me</summary>

<br>

i like making things that feel good to use. not just functional — actually *nice*.

when i'm not coding i'm probably:
- messing with some new framework i found
- redesigning something that didn't need redesigning
- up way too late

</details>
